## What is Cursor?

Cursor is a cutting-edge AI-powered code editor built on VS Code that revolutionizes how developers write code. Unlike traditional editors, Cursor integrates powerful AI capabilities directly into your development workflow, making coding faster, smarter, and more intuitive.

### Key Benefits

With Cursor, you can:

- **Write code faster** with intelligent AI-powered autocompletion
- **Debug more efficiently** with AI-assisted error detection and resolution
- **Refactor confidently** with context-aware code transformations
- **Learn continuously** by asking AI about your codebase
- **Generate code** from natural language descriptions
- **Maintain consistency** across large codebases with AI guidance

## Core AI Features Overview

After [installation](/get-started/installation), you'll have access to these powerful features that work together seamlessly:

### Tab Completion

Cursor's tab completion is powered by advanced AI models that understand your entire codebase context. As you type, you'll receive intelligent suggestions that:

- Complete your current line of code with high accuracy
- Suggest entire function implementations based on your intent
- Help with common patterns and boilerplate code
- Adapt to your coding style and preferences over time
- Work across multiple programming languages

**Getting Started with Tab:**
- Simply start typing and watch AI suggestions appear in gray text
- Press `Tab` to accept suggestions
- Press `Esc` to dismiss unwanted suggestions
- The AI learns from your coding patterns and improves over time

### Chat Interface

Cursor provides a unified AI interface with multiple modes that seamlessly work together for different development tasks.

**Agent Mode (Default)**
- Make codebase-wide changes and complex refactoring
- Implement new features from high-level requirements
- Debug complex issues that span multiple files
- Generate comprehensive tests and documentation
- Maintain consistency across your entire project

**Ask Mode**
- Ask detailed questions about specific code sections
- Get explanations of complex algorithms and functions
- Find code patterns and examples within your project
- Discover and understand large codebases quickly

**Edit Mode**
- Make precise, targeted changes to selected code
- Transform code with natural language instructions
- Apply consistent changes across similar code patterns
- Refactor with confidence using AI guidance

**Quick Start with Chat:**
- Use `⌘I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) to open the chat interface
- Switch between modes during conversations as needed
- Reference specific files with `@filename` syntax
- Use `@docs` to search external documentation

### Context System

Context is the foundation that powers all of Cursor's AI features. Here's how it works effectively:

- **Automatic Indexing**: When you open a codebase, we automatically [index your code](/context/codebase-indexing) to make it available as context
- **@-symbols**: Use [@-symbols](/context/@-symbols/overview) to precisely control what context you provide:
  - [@files](/context/@-symbols/@-files) and [@folders](/context/@-symbols/@-folders) for specific paths
  - [@web](/context/@-symbols/@-web) for external documentation and resources
  - [@git](/context/@-symbols/@-git) for version control context and history
- **Rules**: Configure [rules](/context/rules) to customize AI behavior for your project
- **MCP**: Set up [Model Context Protocol](/context/model-context-protocol) for external context providers

**Overrelying on AI Suggestions**
Many developers becomes too dependent on AI completions without understanding the generated code. This can leads to bugs and security vulnerabilities that are hard to detect later. Always review AI suggestions carefully before accepting them.

**Poor Prompt Engineering**
Users frequently write vague prompts like "make this better" instead of being specific about what they want. The AI works much more effectively when you provide clear, detailed instructions about your goals and constraints.

**Ignoring Context Management**
One of the most common issues is not properly managing context. Users forget to use @-symbols to include relevant files or documentation, resulting in suggestions that doesn't fit their specific use case.

### Pro Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple tasks like code completion before moving to complex refactoring
2. **Be Patient**: The AI learning curve varies between users - some pick it up quickly, others need more time
3. **Experiment Regularly**: Try different approaches to find what works best for your coding style

Remember: Cursor is most effective when you maintain a collaborative mindset with the AI rather than treating it as a replacement for your own thinking.
